  "summaryShort": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the intelligence demonstrated by machines, which is different from the natural intelligence we see in humans and animals.

  "summaryLong": "Artificial intelligence, or AI, is essentially the study of how machines can show intelligence, contrasting with the natural intelligence found in living creatures like animals and humans. AI research defines its field by focusing on the concept of \"intelligent agents.\" An intelligent agent is any type of system that has the ability to observe and understand its surrounding environment. Crucially, the agent then uses that perception to choose actions that will maximize its chances of achieving specific, assigned objectives.",
